Effective for comboing into itself at low percents, and into aerial attacks from mid to high percents; however, the former combo can be escaped with the proper combination of DI and SDI, and can be punished on hit at very low percents. Unlike in SSB4, the move's altered animation results in the hitbox being positioned fairly high to the ground on the first frame it is active, creating a blindspot and making it fairly difficult or even impossible to hit shorter or crouching characters with the move. It appears to be based on the second hit of the Mega Glove's combo from Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.",

Though it is Mario's slowest ground attack, coming out on frame 15, it is among the quicker forward smashes and considered among the best in the game for several reasons: It is Mario's most powerful KO move when sweet spotted, KOing as low as 65% by the ledge, the fireball itself is disjointed, can be angled downwards or upwards to hit ledge hangs, and the start-up animation has Mario pull back his hurtbox deceptively far, inadvertently allowing him to avoid several attacks.

Its quick startup at frame 9 makes it a useful out of shield option, as well as being difficult to react to if the opponent is within its range. His head is intangible while its hitboxes are active, giving it pseudo-disjointed range. Its hitboxes reach behind Mario a good distance but do not reach as far in front of him, thus having trouble hitting short or crouching opponents in front of him. It has very fast interruptibility for its strength, at frame 40, and its damage output is also just enough to make it difficult for most characters to punish out of shield.",

Mario's fastest smash attack, coming out as fast as all his tilts, and both hits semi-spike opponents, though the frontal hit is rather weak in comparison to the back hit.

It is useful for breaking out of combos due to its very fast startup (frame 3), and as a versatile horizontal combo extender, as well as for locking opponents. Autocancels in a short hop. Can combo into a tilt attack, up aerial, or grab at low percents if landing on the ground shortly after the hit, as well as boasting numerous KO confirms off the late hit at high percents.

Possesses a rather low startup and ending lag, making the move reasonably safe to use barring its short range and lack of disjointed hitboxes. It also has a landing hitbox that combos reliably into tilts or a grab. However, opponents will occasionally break out of the move before the final hit, especially when Mario is moving quickly through the air. Useful as a combo finisher, combo breaker, and general damage-racking option, and can KO opponents deceptively well at high percentages. Resembles the Spin Jump, a technique that first appeared in Super Mario World.",

Mario grabs the opponent by the feet, making them fall to the ground and spins three times while holding them by the legs before throwing them backward. Can KO even the heaviest of characters reliably at around 160% near the edge without the need of rage, but can KO middleweights as early as 120% if they fail to DI. It also has solid use in matches with more than one player, as the collateral hit has a large range and high knockback. Due to its slow speed, it is easy to DI, causing it to KO only above 160%.

Bowser spins around dramatically during the descent. It has a quick frame 6 startup and does strong vertical knockback that can KO at 130%, making it a deadly mixup tool in the air. However, it is very susceptible to DI giving it somewhat mediocre KO power if used too far from the edge of the stage. The move also has a massive 46 frames of endlag on whiff, making it very punishable. The suplex can hit other opponents on the descent for similarly powerful knockback. It can be used to dive off-stage with the opponent for a potential sacrificial KO, although this becomes more difficult to do if Bowser has a higher percent, and it is possible to recover if the opponent has a good vertical recovery. The ascent grants intangibility (frames 1-23), and can launch opponents significantly far when falling, although the explosion has no hitbox. The move deals more damage based on fall distance, following the formula 18x(1+0.003d) where d = landing height - grab height, maxing out at 100 units (18x1.3)-roughly the distance from Temple's highest platform to the ground below it.",

On the ground, Bowser performs a weak headbutt that drags opponents into the main attack, which is impossible to avoid if hit by it. If performed in the air, Bowser performs the Ground Pound after a brief pause instead of leaping first. Emits a shockwave upon landing and will break full shields if all of its grounded hitboxes connect. It will almost certainly cause a self-destruct if used off-stage due to its ending lag, though it can grab ledges if Bowser is near one. The startup can meteor smash, although it is rather weak in knockback despite its high damage. It resembles the attack he uses during his boss fight in Super Mario Bros. 3.",

Appears to be based off of when DK holds an item in Donkey Kong Country, such as a Steel Keg. This gives him access to forward, back, up, and down throws that are distinct from his normal grabs. He also gains Knockback-based Armor when he starts a throw instead of gaining Throw Invulnerability, of which allows him to resist up to 16 Units of Knockback, akin to Bowser's Tough Guy. The Kong is also quite maneuverable, walking and jumping.\nForward: Rears back and violently throws the opponent forward at a high angle. Able to stage spike if Donkey Kong faces the stage center.\nBack: Heaves the opponent backwards using both hands, launching them at a slightly higher trajectory than the forwards variant. This is his most damaging cargo throw and possesses the best kill power as well.\nUp: Heaves the opponent upwards. It can be used to start combos. It also has decent KO potential, with Donkey Kong able to jump on platforms for extra height.\nDown: A bear hug.\nWhen the opponent is too damaged to escape in time, all of these throws allow for easy stage spikes. Donkey Kong can simply walk off the edge, pull back and throw them against the underside. However, this carries significant risk, as the opponent can tech it and thus result in DK ending up too far below the edge to recover if his timing is off.\nKong Karry has its own unique Grab mash frame equation, that being 163 + Ceiling[3.2 * Opponent's %] - 18 * N (valid inputs) - n (time held before cargo + previous mash before cargo). For the time held and the previous mash, the Ultimate grab equation would have to be used, which is 89 + Ceiling[1.7 * Opponent's %] - floor[14.4 or 8 (Button or Directional mashing) * N (valid inputs)] holding frames."

It can be angled like her forward tilt, with the upward angle dealing more damage and knockback, though it can typically miss as a result; conversely, the downward angle can hit ledge hanging opponents, but deals slightly less damage and knockback.",

The flying kick also has a sweetspot at her foot that can meteor smash aerial opponents but has slightly less knockback against aerial opponents.

The sword also emits a shockwave upon hitting a solid surface, which is Kirby's only projectile aside from spitting out an Inhaled opponent. A good vertical recovery move and has decent horizontal distance when angled. Can also punish improper aerial approaches, but overuse will render Kirby vulnerable to punishment due to the high start-up. Kirby cannot sweetspot the edge until he starts to descend, and if the platform beneath him disappears or if he is pushed off while he is still in the landing animation, he will be rendered helpless.",

Also great for catching horizontal recovery options, but it leaves Fox vulnerable offstage due to very high ending lag and Fox's high falling speed.

As a result, it is an excellent tool in the neutral game, allowing Falco to put out a lasting hitbox with little risk of punishment. It is also a potent edgeguarding tool due to the meteor smash's sheer speed. On grounded opponents, the move instead launches them directly upward at a slight angle with higher base knockback but much lower knockback scaling, granting it combo potential at a wide variety of percents, including into a second down aerial as a KO combo.

On the ground, Rollout's direction can be changed mid-roll, which deals no damage until the turn is complete; in the air, pressing left or right will alter Jigglypuff's roll speed. When Rollout is fully charged, Jigglypuff will voice its name and briefly flash. Hitting a non-shielding opponent will cause Jigglypuff to rebound, which renders it unable to do anything else, apart from shifting its direction, until it lands or is hit. It can, however, control its direction during the rebound. This makes Rollout dangerous to use off-stage or at an edge, since the rebound will cause Jigglypuff to spin helplessly as it descends to the lower blast line.

It can KO middleweights at around 90% if all hits connect and is very fast for its power, with its initial scooping hitbox coming out on frame 9 and its overhead hitbox frame 10. However, due to jostling, the initial hitbox can sometimes miss even at point blank range, making it unreliable as an out of shield punish unless the opponent lands very close to Mewtwo's shield. The large, disjointed, long-lasting overhead hitbox can work as an anti-air against landing aerials, but opponents can air dodge through it with good timing. It has an enormous 43 frames of ending lag, making it very easy to punish if it misses due to the reasons above and making it a very high-risk, high-reward maneuver.",

It is incredibly powerful, KOing at around 90% and sending at an awkward 55° angle that makes optimal DI ambiguous. While it has noticeable startup at frame 21, its ending lag relative to its power and startup is extremely low, as Mewtwo can act out of it after 41 frames. Combined with its extra shield damage, it is safe on shield against most characters, and potentially even on whiff. This makes it a non-committal punish against landings, spotdodges, etc., helped by its lack of a sourspot. It can also act as a powerful 2-frame punish at the ledge due to its generous hitbox and three active frames. While it lacks a traditional sourspot, its outer hitbox only affects grounded opponents and deals less shield damage than its inner hitbox.",

Its hitboxes are positioned at Mewtwo's hands and feet and keep the opponent trapped, whereas its last hitbox launches them. Its fast startup and long duration make it great for catching jumps. It is Mewtwo's best out-of-shield option, hitting on both sides, although it is hard to consistently connect because of the extremely small hitboxes.

It also boasts combo potential at low percentages, as it can also combo into itself, down tilt, Shadow Ball and more. It is a very safe poking option because of its range, safety on shield and low landing lag. However, it is susceptible to anti airs as it is not disjointed. It can also be used as an edgeguarding tool, albeit with some difficulty due to the hitbox.\nIts speed, safety, range, and utility at all percentages make it a staple in Mewtwo's neutral game and moveset, and it is not uncommon for it to be considered the best forward aerial in the game.",

The move has a sweetspot closer to the bulb that deals much more knockback, though the sourspot still meteor smashes. It is capable of hitting opponents easily out of a short hop, even from above platforms; at higher percents, it will cause grounded opponents to launch off the floor, allowing Ivysaur to punish missed techs and/or tech-chase with a multitude of moves, including any ground move or Bullet Seed. At even higher percents, up aerial will work as a KO combo at 130%, while up smash can act as a potent hard read from a wide range of percentages. Its enormous hitbox allows it to hit most characters below the stage before they can even sweetspot the ledge. As a result, down aerial is one of Ivysaur's most useful aerial moves.",

However, it has the slowest startup at frame 16 and shortest hitbox duration out of Ike's aerials, as well as poor horizontal range. Like all of Ike's other aerial attacks, it also has severe ending lag.",

It grants super armor when initiated and until Ike begins rising, which is longer if the move is used on the ground, while all but its first hit have transcendent priority.

Due to update 2.0.0 decreasing its descending hitbox's knockback, it has become slightly less reliable at KOing opponents early.

There is a weak hitbox on the bomb (shortly before Mr. Game & Watch drops it) that slightly pushes midair opponents downward that deals set knockback, disallowing it to kill at any percentage. Hitting grounded opponents with the first hit will set them up to be hit by the second. Even if an opponent is hit from behind, the explosion always launches them whichever direction Mr. Game & Watch is facing.

However it is unarguably Palutena's worst aerial for a number of reasons. Due to it hitting on frame 10, it is tied with her up aerial for her slowest aerial. It also has the shortest range, duration, and worst autocancel window of her aerials (autocanceling late in a full hop), while its knockback is only average for a meteor smash at best. It also has immense ending lag (47 frames) which is among the laggiest aerials in the game. Additionally, it only lasts 2 frames and combined with its lack of vertical reach make it hard to use effectively. This makes it among the hardest to land aerials in the game and as such, makes it a very high risk, but only moderate reward move with characters like Ivysaur, Luigi and Cloud having noticeable better meteor smashes at a similar or even faster speed.",

The first two hits can lock floored characters, although this is difficult to perform on most characters due to the move's height. The first two hits have very low ending lag, allowing for reaction-based reads or the ability to jab cancel into Rising Uppercut; this acts as a KO combo at various percents, with hit 2 working past around 145%, and hit 1 working past 200%.

Little Mac also rushes forward during before the hitbox becomes active, giving it deceptively good range, but the hitboxes don't reach far in front of him. It's pretty versatile for a forward smash or smash attack in general, as each directional input behaves almost like different moves as opposed to other forward smashes just changing their angle of attack, allowing Little Mac options for powerful knockback either horizontally or vertically, or dealing heavy damage or shield damage.\nUp: An uppercut. It launches opponents vertically and has the largest hitbox out of all three punch variations, which makes it the easiest to connect while also being a good anti-air. It does powerful vertical knockback that KOs Mario at 102%, allowing it to finish off fighters with poor vertical endurance. It also grants super armor on frames 8-15. On opponents at 0 percent (or at extremely low percents with rage), should Little Mac armor an attack and successfully connect this move, it can frame trap opponents into many vertical moves including KO Uppercut, due to the Special Zoom giving Little Mac extra hit advantage. It resembles Little Mac's Star Punch and One-Star Punch in the NES and Wii versions of Punch-Out!!, respectively.\nForward: A cross. It has the highest knockback scaling out of all three punch variations, KOing Mario from center-stage at 89%. This makes it the most reliable out of the three in regard to KOing. It also grants super armor on frames 8-15. It is based on the cross Little Mac hits King Hippo with during the cutscene in which he defeats Hippo in the Wii version of Punch-Out!!\nDown: A body hook. It deals the most damage out of all three punch variations, but its extremely low knockback scaling makes it unusable for KOing. Its high shieldstun makes it safer on shield than the other two punch variations, and it deals heavy shield damage, allowing it to deplete more than half a shield.

It has tremendous vertical range that is capable of reaching through the main platform of Town and City; however, it has very minimal horizontal range and each hit only lasts 2 frames, which can make it difficult to connect with, especially if Shulk has too much momentum. It is one of the most damaging up aerials in the game if both hits connect (sweetspot only); coupled with its second hit's high knockback growth, it is a fearsome (albeit difficult to land) KO option near the upper blast line. It also has the second lowest landing lag out of Shulk's aerials (9 frames), giving it some spammability if under a platform. If the second hit of an up aerial lands, Shulk can land, switch into another Art, and combo into another up aerial; this is a KO confirm known as the \"Monado Cyclone\" that can work at a wide percent range with the right Arts active, though it is quite difficult to set up. Except for the Buster Art, if the second hit is sweetspotted, it is the strongest up aerial in the game, KOing slightly earlier than Zelda's.",

Previously one of the strongest counters in Smash 4, its knockback scaling has remained similar and it is nearly as strong as it was, but it has lost its unblockable properties. Monado Arts can affect the KO potential of the counterattack. As a downside, Vision loses counter frames if repeatedly used over a short period of time, making it and Witch Time the only counterattacks that lose effectiveness if spammed.

In comparison, an inputted Shoryuken is Ryu's most powerful vertical KOing option overall and has the highest growth in his entire standard moveset, and can be also used as a risky method to escape combos due to its intangibility.

Crumples opponents where they stand with a lengthy stun animation if charged for more than half a second, which can allow for follow-ups. Ryu gains heavy armor that can withstand a single hit while it is charging, depending on the amount of charge (16.8%-33.6%). When fully charged, the attack becomes unblockable and will pierce through counterattacks. Peculiarly, if a fully charged focus attack hits a shield at any distance it will still crumple even if the shielding opponent is out of range, essentially making the move more effective on shielding enemies. The move's charge is indicated by Ryu flashing during its start-up. Level 1 is performed immediately and slightly launches an opponent. Level 2 is performed after half a second and crumples an opponent, but deals the least amount of damage. Level 3 is performed after a whole second, can block any normal single hit attack, crumples the opponent for a much longer time and deals the most amount of damage. Ryu can also perform a technique called the Focus Attack Dash Cancel. This is performed by tapping left or right twice, which cancels Focus Attack and instead propels Ryu a set distance depending on where the control stick was tapped. However if the punch misses, Ryu will be unable to cancel the move. If the move hits an airborne opponent, they will instead by launched with heavy hitlag. Although Focus Attack cannot block grabs and is countered by multiple hit attacks, it is a useful tool for baiting opponents and punishing, while its Dash Cancel can function as a horizontal recovery option while offstage.",

Its fast startup makes it a good surprise attack when grounded, particularly as an out of shield option.\nIts Limit Break variant greatly strengthens the rising (but not falling) hits of the move (allowing it to KO grounded middleweights at around 125%), allows it to sweetspot edges throughout, grants Cloud intangibility on startup and much greater vertical and horizontal distance.",

While the move is being held, a text box labeled \"Limit\" appears above Cloud, which contains a meter that denotes the current level of Limit and increases as it is charged. The Limit Gauge will reach full charge either by using Limit Charge for 335 frames but can be alternatively filled by dealing 150% or receiving 100% and each of these methods stacks with each other. When the Limit Gauge is fully charged, Cloud will say \"\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\", which translates to \"limits are meant to be broken\" or \"breaking the limit\". The move can be charge-canceled by pressing the shield button, hitting the control stick left or right (which triggers a roll), grabbing, or pressing the special button again (the latter of which has an 8-frame delay). When the Limit Gauge is filled, Cloud is surrounded by a blue, fiery aura, and his mobility receives a noticeable increase. As long as he is in this state, he has access to much more powerful, single use variants of his special attacks, as listed above. Using any of these attacks will empty the Limit Gauge and return Cloud to his normal state, even if the move misses or is interrupted. The charge goes away in 15 seconds if it isn't used at all when fully charged.\nThe Limit Break variation of Limit Charge itself is an entirely different attack called Finishing Touch; Cloud slashes in an arc around himself, generating a large whirlwind that deals only 1% damage but deals tremendous knockback, enough to KO most opponents before 70%. The move hits on frame 14 but has very high ending lag and almost no shield stun due to its damage output. The attack is weaker as a whole when performed in the air, however, KOing about 24% later when hit in the front, and 36% later with the back hitbox. The attack's hitbox is deceptively large, and it generates a powerful windbox that extends even further beyond the Buster Sword's range, pushing opponents away.

Unlike Marth and Lucina's Critical Hit, Cloud will dash off the edges of platforms if Omnislash is initiated next to one, and he cannot cancel the move.

The move can be cancelled by shielding or rolling, but only when fully charged. This move takes inspiration from the Bullet Climax and Charge Bullet techniques from Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2, respectively. Bayonetta alternates between two animations while charging and firing for each time she uses Bullet Climax: either she stands in a semi-crouching position and fires the guns in her hands, or she does a handstand and fires the guns on her feet. Both function identically, although Kirby's Copy Ability fires from noticeably different heights. Due to its angle, it is useful for edge-guarding and hindering aerial approaches, with the charged version being an extremely powerful KO option against recovering opponents. The uncharged version can also lock opponents on platforms."

      "description":"A kick that functions differently when used on the ground or in midair. All versions are based on the individual techniques from the Bayonetta games, with minor differences.\nHeel Slide: On the ground, she performs the Heel Slide. If the button is held, Bayonetta will then follow it up with an a\u00fa aberto. She will also fire the guns on her feet as she slides. It is her primary combo starter, due to the follow-up kick launching the opponent upward. If the first hit is shielded, however, she will not transition to the a\u00fa aberto. She will also be under considerable endlag, leaving her open to punishing.\nAfter Burner Kick: In the air, she alternately performs the After Burner Kick, a flying kick with a slightly diagonal trajectory which can be performed twice in a row as long as the first kick connects. If shielded, it can't transition into another After Burner Kick. It can be angled diagonally downward by two different methods: holding the control stick down before inputting the move (moving the stick in a quarter-circle), or by flicking the control stick down as soon as the move is inputted but before the move comes out. The second method takes strict timing: if not performed correctly, she will end up doing the standard After Burner Kick. If the button is held for the standard version, Bayonetta will fire the guns on her feet (one slightly upward, and one slightly downward).\nLike Witch Twist, both versions of After Burner Kick are her primary aerial combo initiators and followups, with each angled version having different launch angles and allowing for creative combos.",

Based on the technique of the same name from Bayonetta, as well as a variation from Bayonetta 2 known as Witch Strike; the ability to hold guns is taken from the former, but lacks the dodging spinning kick at the start. It hits multiple times but covers minimal vertical distance and extremely minimal horizontal distance, similarly to Rising Uppercut. Despite this, Witch Twist is still a very useful recovery option, as she is allowed to use one Witch Twist after each jump, including after a double jump (allowing for a maximum of two Witch Twists before landing). Holding the button causes Bayonetta to additionally fire her guns from her hands and feet; hitting anyone directly above or below, to her sides, and slightly diagonally under her. It is overall her primary combo initiator and extender along with Witch Twist/After Burner Kick, as its low endlag and multiple uses allow her to perform an impressive variety of aerial strings. Witch Twist is also essential for Bayonetta's ladder combos, as she can immediately perform another Witch Twist after the first one ends with precise timing, which can drag opponents close to the top blast line. Each Witch Twist's final hit has different knockback trajectories, with the first sending diagonally upwards and the second sending at a horizontal angle with low knockback; the latter allows Bayonetta to consistently combo into aerials (the most common being forward aerial).\nWith precise timing (a 4 frame window), a double jump can be cancelled into Witch Twist, thereby saving her jump in a similar way to Smash 4. This drastically improves her combo game and enables some particularly powerful ladder combos, as well as some much needed recovery mix-ups. This can be executed with both the first and second Witch Twists (as long as the double jump is unused) only to use the double jump right after, essentially giving her a maximum of three midair jumps, though only one would reach the top of its arch.",

The cutscene consists of her using her hair as a conduit to summon Gomorrah, who then damages any opponents suffering hitstun from Bayonetta's attacks by chomping them four times before they are launched with set knockback. The attack button can be mashed during the attack to fill a second Climax Gauge that deals an additional 15% after the cutscene. Once the cutscene ends, anyone with 100% or more will be instantly KO'd. Anyone below 100% will take an additional 10% as the Final Smash ends."

The plank comes out later and has a big hitbox, but deals less damage and knockback, making it more suited for covering the headbutt or ledgetrapping at best. The plank animation weakly meteor smashes opponents, though this is ineffective for edgeguarding due to its low knockback. In addition, it is the weakest meteor smash in the game, failing to KO at realistic percents. It can be used to force tech situations or awkward placements off-stage, but these are highly situational and impractical. The sheer number of hits do make it useful for causing shield damage under platforms. Each hitbox is situated on K. Rool's head and body respectively, meaning it can miss entirely if used poorly.

Its properties make it K. Rool's best combo starter at low percents, with sweetspot being able to lead into neutral attack, forward tilt, up tilt, dash attack and grab at low percents.

      "description":"An upward battering ram. Causes K. Rool to float slightly, giving it more reach. It has extremely high ending lag, preventing K. Rool from acting even if performed out of a double jump, making it risky to use offstage and making it the laggiest aerial in the game. However, is one of K. Rool's fastest aerial attacks (comes out on frame 7), and deals less damage if hit later. In addition to this, the early hitbox is among the strongest up aerials in the game, being able to KO at around 100% and even earlier if used near the upper blast zone, giving K. Rool a possibility to pick up very early KOs with the move, especially with rage. The early hit has a large, disjointed hitbox much larger than K. Rool's head, which also lingers for a disproportionately long time. The move has Belly Super Armor while K. Rool stretches his head out, ending after the hitboxes are over. When short hopped, this move can allow K. Rool to move onto a platform, allowing for some movement options, and significantly helps with the issue of the move having high endlag. Like up smash, there are intangibility frames on K. Rool's head during the attack, making it disjointed and allowing it to beat projectiles or some other even reasonably disjointed moves, such as Mr. Game & Watch's down aerial. This move can also be used for recovering from high to mid levels, as K. Rool can be moved from side to side while using the move.",

If the opponent is hit by the early hitbox - but not meteor smashed - on-stage by this move, it confirms a wide variety of attacks. There is also a late hitbox with a sweetspot on the hip, with 20 extra stats in knockback growth, plus a sourspot on the feet. It also has Belly Super Armor after K.

Down throw follows up to numerous moves depending on the opponent's percent, including jab, up tilt, and up air at lower to mid percents, as well as forward tilt, forward and down smash at higher percents. It is also possible to infinite many fighters by throwing them, using jab while they're buried and re-grabbing them when they are released. However, most followups can be avoided if the opponent mashes out (especially since the throw itself is slow and gives plenty of time to react), making its KO setups unreliable at much higher percents. Only dash attack, forward and up tilts are able to follow up at 125% and KO reliably. However, up smash and up aerial can be used to discourage mashing and create 50/50 situations at lower percents, as the prior KOs at 100% a lot of the time.",

After a Kannonball is fired, the special button can be held to use the blunderbuss's vacuum function, sucking in nearby enemies or the Kannonball itself (though the move will eventually cancel after several seconds), similarly to Inhale. K. Rool can drop through soft platforms while vacuuming with his blunderbuss, and he also can move left and right as well while airborne, which is very useful for ledgetrapping. Once it sucks something in, K. Rool will immediately launch it out at a slight angle upward in front or behind him, or directly upwards, depending on the held direction. The blunderbuss \"throw\" KOs at 100% near the edge of Final Destination, though it deals lower knockback upwards or if reversed.

If successful, Ridley slams them onto the ground and drags them forward along it, dealing continuous damage, then throws them either upon reaching an edge or if the special move button is held. After frame 22 (just after Ridley starts sliding) he has damage-based armor that can take up to 8%. The move deals more damage the more distance the opponent is dragged along the ground, dealing 17% minimum when throwing manually, and can rack up a lot of damage in a short span of time. However, they can mash out of the move before Ridley throws them, with how fast they can escape depending on the difference between their percent and Ridley's. In midair, it doesn't incur helplessness, allowing it to extend Ridley's recovery, and grabbing an opponent causes him to fall down with them until landing or throwing them manually, allowing it to be used for a sacrificial KO. However, it has some startup lag, and the aerial version causes Ridley to drop downwards after its horizontal momentum ends, making it possible to mistime a recovery.",

The move travels a long distance, does not lose power while traveling, has a wide ledge grabbing range throughout, and lets Ridley drift significantly when done. It is also noticeably powerful: the forward and upward tackles KO under 130% from center stage, whereas the diving stomp meteor smashes aerial targets while also allowing Ridley to save himself by grabbing an edge, making it potentially deadly for edgeguarding. However, the move has very slow startup, and its few angles limit the positions from which Ridley can safely recover with it.

Upon executing the lariat, Incineroar poses with its arms in the air and performs \"devil horn\" signs with both its paws, while tilting its head upwards. The lariat deals 20% and can KO at 72% from the edge of Final Destination. The back body drop deals 12% and can KO at 159% (or earlier with a low ceiling).

The buff lasts for a very long time (approximately 60 seconds), though its duration is reduced slightly each time Incineroar gets hit and lost entirely if Incineroar is grabbed and thrown. Once a powered up move lands, the buff is removed. If a smash attack, Cross Chop, or Alolan Whip's lariat hits while Revenge is active, the camera will perform the Special Zoom. With maximum stacks, Incineroar is able to do about 70% with just a single smash attack, giving it some of the strongest possible attacks in standard matches.

If it connects with an opponent, Byleth latches onto the opponent before footstooling them, dealing damage based on how far away the opponent was; if their percentage is at least 50% when they are footstooled, it becomes an untechable meteor smash. This footstool has only one frame of ending lag, allowing Byleth to immediately follow up with any of his aerials or special moves, with combos into moves such as neutral aerial (though this particular combo is only effective against Donkey Kong), back aerial, and reverse-inputted side special. Against grounded opponents, the move first launches them up with the sword to allow Byleth to latch onto them.

When it is used successfully while falling off the battlefield, by an edge, and it hits the battlefield, Byleth will be suspended, ending the fall. Much like the aforementioned \"bold\" moves, it expectedly has extremely high lag all around in exchange for its power, making it a very risky yet rewarding move mainly used for hard reads.

If the target is already buried, Inkling is airborne, or the Roller is moving too slow, it will apply ink but knock the opponent upward instead of burying them. If the opponent is airborne, the Roller will not hit them. After rolling for a set distance, Inkling can cancel the move with the special or attack button, jump out of the animation, turn around by pressing back or maintain her speed by holding forward. Otherwise, the move will slow down until it no longer deals damage. In the air, the Roller can only be used once before landing, but jumping out of the move does not use a double jump, allowing it to extend Inkling's recovery. If Roller is started without ink, Inkling will slowly walk forward with a dejected look, and cannot speed up or deal damage. If Inkling runs out of ink mid-Roller, the attack will deal damage if it is still traveling fast enough, but will not bury or apply ink.

Charging it for some time results in Megaflare, a blue flame that is more powerful and has a larger explosion, but travels a shorter distance. Fully charging it results in Gigaflare, which causes the background to darken dramatically, and the music's volume to lower; the small, yellow spark fired travels an extremely short distance, but results in an immense explosion with extreme knockback, being capable of KOing most characters as low as 20% near a ledge, or even potentially KOing at 0% if in Winged form.

Despite Gigaflare being extremely slow to start, its very large hitbox makes it a notoriously effective edgetrapping tool, allowing it to simultaneously cover nearly every option when timed correctly; against opponents with a reflector, Sephiroth can simply cancel the charge and punish the attack. All three versions can be reflected and absorbed; it should be noted that despite Gigaflare's extreme power, it is relatively unrewarding to absorb due to its initial hit dealing very low damage.\nWhen releasing Megaflare, Sephiroth may say \u884c\u3051 (\"Go.\"), and when releasing Gigaflare, he may say \u713c\u304d\u5c3d\u304f\u3059 (\"Burn to nothing.\")",

Should it connect, spheres of dark energy will orbit the opponent, then home in on them and explode after the orbs make at least two revolutions around the character. The initial surge can be charged, increasing its damage and range while creating more spheres on hit; an uncharged surge creates only one sphere, whereas a fully charged surge will create three spheres-up to five spheres may be orbiting an opponent at once. Sephiroth can quickly turn 180° before firing Shadow Flare by quickly flicking in the opposite direction. The spheres can also hit bystanders while they orbit around the opponent, with each sphere being able to collide twice before disappearing. The spheres can be reflected and absorbed. If pocketed, the dark sphere is thrown as a standard projectile. In comparison to Sephiroth's other moves, Shadow Flare is very spammable, allowing it to be used frequently without fear of retaliation, and allows him to set up followups or condition the opponent into picking an option. However, the move has very low safety due to it causing minimal hitstun and shield damage.\nWhen using the move, Sephiroth may say \u76ee\u969c\u308a\u3060 (\"Annoying.\" or \"Pathetic.\"), \u713c\u304d\u4ed8\u3051\u308b (\"Burn.\"), \u8dea\u3051 (\"Kneel.\"), \u6ec5\u3073\u308b (\"Perish.\"), \u304f\u3089\u3048 (\"Take this.\") or simply chuckle.",

      "description":"An omnidirectional slash move with a brief charge time, indicated by a directional arrow which points towards Sephiroth's travel direction before he begins moving. It travels similarly to moves like Fire Fox. Grounded versions of both moves will stop at ledges. Its functionality changes based on whether the special move button is tapped or held.\nIf the special move button is tapped, Sephiroth performs Blade Dash, which deals a single hit, travels less distance and can snap to the ledge. It deals low damage, but has moderately low ending and landing lag, allowing it to be used as a movement option.\nIf the special move button is held down, it becomes Octaslash, a multi-hit dash that, true to its name, hits eight times, gaining significantly more power and slightly increased travel distance. It deals high damage and is an effective combat move, but has high ending lag and extremely high landing lag (one of the highest for an up special). It is unreliable at grabbing the ledge; however, its large hitbox can be used to deter opponents from camping a ledge. If Sephiroth starts a midair Octaslash and aims diagonally at the ground, he will travel along the ground as he moves, similarly to Fire Wolf. If he aims directly down towards the ground, however, Sephiroth bounces up slightly and the attack cancels. Octaslash's hits also slow down significantly on hit. Octaslash has great range overall, not only extending far in front of Sephiroth, but also having great reach above and below him; when combining this with the fact that every successive hit has only a 1 frame gap, this makes the move excellent for 2 frame punishing nearly every character when timed correctly.\nWhen using Octaslash, Sephiroth may say \u6d88\u3048\u53bb\u308c (\"Disappear.\"), \u611a\u304b\u306a (\"Foolish.\"), or \u6050\u6016\u3092\u523b\u3080 (\"I carve terror.\")",

It is unique for a counterattack in a few ways: for one, it will activate and deal minimal damage even if an attack does not connect with it, though it still grows stronger like a normal counterattack depending on the damage it has taken. Secondly, it has a damage cap of 25%, after which the barrier will shatter, negating the damage and causing Sephiroth to stagger briefly. Finally, the counterattack is considered a projectile, meaning it can be reflected and absorbed. Despite its appearance suggesting so, Scintilla cannot reflect projectiles, as the barrier breaks and nullifies the projectile as if it hit the damage cap. Like most counterattacks, Scintilla freezes the opponent right before the retaliating hit. Its unique properties make it excellent for edgeguarding any sort of recovery due to its ability to automatically trigger. It is also one of the strongest counters in the game with a damage multiplier of 1.5x, making it tied with Gut Check and Counter Throw as the second strongest counterattack. This move can deter most opponents from sharking with their recovery move, making it effective against attacks that don't snap the ledge as quickly.\nWhen using the move, Sephiroth may say \u76ee\u969c\u308a\u3060 (\"Annoying.\" or \"Pathetic.\"), \u6765\u3044 (\"Come.\"), \u6d88\u3048\u53bb\u308c (\"Disappear.\"), \u611a\u304b\u306a (\"Foolish.\"), \u3044\u3044\u9854\u3060 (\"I like the look on your face.\"), \u6253\u3061\u7815\u304f (\"I will crush you.\"), \u8dea\u3051 (\"Kneel.\") or simply chuckle.",

These status effects include an automatic shield break, being slowed down, having reversed controls (indicated by a mushroom on the victim's head), having a flower planted on the victim's head, being put to sleep, or a simple darkness effect, which is accompanied by more knockback than usual, albeit still on the lower end for a Final Smash.

Mashing the attack button quickly will cause Richter to rapidly spin the whip to damage opponents, with a final uppercut that sends opponents away. If not done quickly enough, Richter will cancel the first two hits, ending the attack and leaving him vulnerable. This move is Richter's fastest option up close.\nIf the attack button is held down instead, Richter will hold out the Vampire Killer, and it can then be manually twirled around. This attack is based on Simon's Whip Twirl from Super Castlevania IV (and was also used by Richter himself in Symphony of the Night), and it is functionally similar to Sheik's Chain in Melee and Brawl. The chain deals minor damage in this way, but can cancel very weak projectiles that collide with it. The spiked ball of the chain is its sweetspot, which deals more damage and sends opponents away. If pushed off a platform by a windbox while doing this, Richter will continue dangling the whip, and can be moved left and right through the air while simultaneously controlling it.",

The first hit, however, is what offers most of this move's combo capabilities;  upon landing the first hit on grounded opponents, it launches them upward with low knockback; this allows it to combo into a plethora of moves, such as another forward aerial, a back aerial, an up aerial, and even up smash, with all of these serving as effective KO confirms. With Ars\u00e8ne, the second kick becomes a powerful KO move that can KO opponents at 100% from the edge, and even earlier when edgeguarding thanks to its base knockback.",

It is widely considered one of the best back aerials in the game for a multitude of reasons; one of which is its extreme speed, coming out on frame 7 and only having 22 frames of ending lag. Another is its overall high knockback, even without Ars\u00e8ne; it's able to KO middleweights at around 120% near the ledge, and due to its spammability and safety on shield, makes it difficult to punish, making it one of his safest KO options. With Ars\u00e8ne, its hitbox size increases due to Ars\u00e8ne mirroring Joker's attack, and it is capable of KOing at around 80% from the edge, and similarly to his forward aerial, can kill at very early percents while edgeguarding due to its base knockback, making it a very strong KO option.

Like with Bayonetta's Bullet Arts, the shots technically are not projectiles, but rather indirect attacks with large disjointed hitboxes. As such, they cannot be reflected or blocked by the shields of all versions of Link or Hero. The shots decay in damage and knockback based on the opponent's distance from Joker, doing no knockback at the furthest distance. The button can be held to fire multiple times; additionally, Joker can dodge between shots by tilting the control stick horizontally, with each use causing the dodge to slow down (much like a roll or sidestep). If he is in midair, he can either fire in a circle around himself (in a similar fashion to Bayonetta's Bullet Arts up aerial) by tilting up, or below himself in a corkscrewing fashion by tilting down. On the ground, Joker can also press the jump button to perform a diagonal jump while rapidly firing shots downwards. When Ars\u00e8ne is out, it becomes Gun Special, where it fires three bullets with each shot for the standard version, and two bullets per shot for the aerial downward version. Both Gun and Gun Special have penetrative properties, meaning they can pass through multiple opponents, and the downward aerial version, in particular, is notorious for its sheer versatility: it can counter combos and juggles, edgeguard effectively, and rack up damage quickly, as Gun has low ending lag and is spammable when used in the air.

However, the hook can be difficult to use due to its small size and hitbox position, and much like Isabelle's Fishing Rod, Grappling Hook can be shielded despite its grab properties. It can also let Joker grab physical items such as Peach's turnips from afar. When Ars\u00e8ne is out, it becomes Wings of Rebellion, where Joker flies upwards or at an angle (again depending on input) using Ars\u00e8ne's wings.

It is quick to throw, but travels very slowly and is very weak. Frizz is the only variant of the Frizz spells that suffers from damage falloff, which means that it gets weaker and slower after traveling a certain distance. Frizz costs 6 MP to use. Frizzle: Two intertwined fireballs that appear when the move is semi-charged. Frizzle is faster and stronger than Frizz. The two fireballs can actually break-off into separate fireballs if an opponent or attack lands on top of one of the fireballs. Frizzle is decently powerful, being able to KO at 135% near the ledge. Frizzle costs 16 MP to use.\nKafrizz: The strongest version of Frizz that appears when the move is fully charged. It is a large, multi-hitting fireball deals extremely high damage and knockback, KOing at around 60% near the ledge. It also deals considerably high shield damage.

These eggs will obey gravity, bounce off the ground and linger for quite some time (around the length of half of Final Destination) before breaking on their own, and become weaker as time passes. It is rather slow to fire, making the projectile mostly suited for stage control. If the special button is held, the duo will instead perform the Breegull Blaster, where Banjo takes Kazooie out of his backpack and uses her in a manner similar to the Super Scope. In this mode, pressing either attack button will cause Kazooie to quickly fire smaller and weaker eggs that travel in a straight line and as far as a third of Final Destination's length; subsequent eggs gradually deal less damage. These smaller eggs cause minimal flinching at long range and weak vertical knockback at close range. Banjo can move and triple jump freely while in this mode, and can turn around (the latter is not possible while firing). Crouching or shielding will put Kazooie away, which has minimal ending lag; this allows Breegull Blaster to start aerial combos. Due to the mechanics of this move, Egg Firing can only be done repeatedly if the player button mashes, since holding the button transitions into the Breegull Blaster.

It is only usable up to 5 times per stock, which is denoted by the amount of Golden Feathers above their heads. Each successful use consumes 1 Golden Feather, although interrupting the move before the hitbox begins will not use up a feather. To compensate, it has a large amount of strengths: the move grants full invincibility from the start of the dash (frame 18) to the end, including immunity to almost all Final Smashes that do not grab the opponent, the clean hit deals a high amount of damage, shield damage, and knockback, and can KO at the edge at 60%, while the late hit is still powerful and can KO effectively offstage or catch options of edge-hanging opponents. It works very well as a horizontal recovery option, as it does not cause helplessness and travels an excellent amount of horizontal distance. However, the move is specifically designed to be out-prioritized by grabs, and grabbing the duo out of the move causes it to only deal 0.25x damage to the grabber. Its high startup and ending lag also makes it punishable if it misses or is shielded, which is compounded by the move's reduced shieldstun, especially on the late hit. If they attempt to use it without any feathers remaining, they simply stumble over; an aerial use will cause them to fumble in midair, and using it close to the ground will cause Banjo to land face-first in his floored animation.

It is also the only one of his aerial attacks that cannot autocancel if performed immediately from a short hop fast fall. Like Ryu and Ken, Terry can have difficulty performing a back aerial during one-on-one matches, since he automatically turns towards his opponent. As a result, he must perform a reverse aerial rush in order to use it in on one-on-one matches. Compared to Ryu and Ken, however, this takes longer to perform as Terry, as he will only pivot around as part of his turnaround, and not in a dash dance (without performing a reverse aerial rush, it is impossible to jump off-stage while facing towards it if the opponent is off-stage). Much like his forward aerial, it can only special cancel into his Final Smash. Based on his jumping heavy kick when jumping straight up in most games.",
