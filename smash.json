Effective for comboing into itself at low percents, and into aerial attacks from mid to high percents; however, the former combo can be escaped with the proper combination of DI and SDI, and can be punished on hit at very low percents. Unlike in SSB4, the move's altered animation results in the hitbox being positioned fairly high to the ground on the first frame it is active, creating a blindspot and making it fairly difficult or even impossible to hit shorter or crouching characters with the move. It appears to be based on the second hit of the Mega Glove's combo from Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.",

Its quick startup at frame 9 makes it a useful out of shield option, as well as being difficult to react to if the opponent is within its range. His head is intangible while its hitboxes are active, giving it pseudo-disjointed range. Its hitboxes reach behind Mario a good distance but do not reach as far in front of him, thus having trouble hitting short or crouching opponents in front of him. It has very fast interruptibility for its strength, at frame 40, and its damage output is also just enough to make it difficult for most characters to punish out of shield.",

Mario's fastest smash attack, coming out as fast as all his tilts, and both hits semi-spike opponents, though the frontal hit is rather weak in comparison to the back hit. Also capable of hitting ledge hangs. The animation in Ultimate more closely resembles Mario's breakdance from Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix.",

It is useful for breaking out of combos due to its very fast startup (frame 3), and as a versatile horizontal combo extender, as well as for locking opponents. Autocancels in a short hop. Can combo into a tilt attack, up aerial, or grab at low percents if landing on the ground shortly after the hit, as well as boasting numerous KO confirms off the late hit at high percents.

It has the slowest startup of his standard moveset (frame 16), high ending lag, and is Mario's only aerial that doesn't autocancel in a short hop. Other than lacking combo potential, the early and late hits are too weak to KO reliably.",

Also capable of killing at higher percents, and can be used twice in a short hop, or with neutral, up and down airs.",

Has extremely fast startup (frame 4), consistent strength throughout the move and very low ending and landing lag, making it one of Mario's most versatile combo starters and extenders in his moveset. Can combo into itself easily until higher percents, and can kill off the top at high percents.",

					"description":"Rapidly spins around, trapping opponents and damaging them with a series of discus clotheslines and spinning backfists before assuming a spread-eagle position to launch them. Possesses a rather low startup and ending lag, making the move reasonably safe to use barring its short range and lack of disjointed hitboxes. It also has a landing hitbox that combos reliably into tilts or a grab. However, opponents will occasionally break out of the move before the final hit, especially when Mario is moving quickly through the air. Useful as a combo finisher, combo breaker, and general damage-racking option, and can KO opponents deceptively well at high percentages. Resembles the Spin Jump, a technique that first appeared in Super Mario World.",
